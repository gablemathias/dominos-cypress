[Spec with the End-to-End Tests](https://github.com/gablemathias/pizzahut-cypress/blob/main/cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js)

Here's a summary of the process I automated:

1. Access the website
2. Click on "New Order"
3. Accept the cookies
4. Fill in blank fields (address, etc.)
5. Select the pizza
6. Modify the dough type
7. Add to cart
8. Reach the payment page
9. Check the cart
